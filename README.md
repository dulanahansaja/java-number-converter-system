README for iCALC Number Converter System
Project Overview
The iCALC Number Converter System is a Java application designed to convert numbers between different numeral systems. The application supports conversions for decimal, binary, octal, hexadecimal, and Roman numeral systems. Users interact with the application through a Command Line Interface (CLI), selecting options to perform various conversions.

Features
Decimal Converter

Converts a positive decimal number to its binary, octal, and hexadecimal equivalents.
Validates input to ensure it's a positive integer.
Handles invalid input gracefully, prompting the user to re-enter or return to the home page.
Binary Converter

Converts a binary number to its decimal, octal, and hexadecimal equivalents.
Validates input to ensure it only contains the digits 0 and 1.
Handles invalid input similarly to the Decimal Converter.
Octal Converter

Converts an octal number to its decimal, binary, and hexadecimal equivalents.
Validates input to ensure it only contains digits between 0 and 7.
Handles invalid input similarly to the previous converters.
Hexadecimal Converter

Converts a hexadecimal number to its decimal, binary, and octal equivalents.
Validates input to ensure it contains valid hexadecimal digits (0-9, A-F).
Handles invalid input similarly to the previous converters.
Roman Number Converter

Decimal to Roman Converter: Converts a decimal number to its Roman numeral equivalent.
Roman to Decimal Converter: Converts a Roman numeral to its decimal equivalent.
